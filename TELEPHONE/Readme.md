Telephone module

## **Libraries Used**

### Pygame

Pygame a cross platform set of python modules which is used for video games.
Its a library which retruns the interactions with a player when pressing on a keyboard.

**Resources**: I learned how to manage the library from this link https://www.pygame.org/docs/ .

- A **CONFIG FILE** is created to store the directories and pins used with the raspberry pi 3B.

- Placing a **CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY** command to print the running file directory, if you run the script from any point in the folder.

## **Functoinality**
The player starts to dial once he takes a call. Then a regular check on the number
entered is done until reaching the correct code to display the correct voice recording.

## **Notes** 
- The sound recordings are stored in the **sounds folder**.
- The phone was used from the Rabuun room which was built by Cologne.
